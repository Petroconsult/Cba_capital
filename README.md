# Cba_capital

This repository is a Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS starter configured for the CBA Capital project.

## Getting started

1. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in any secrets.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The `src/app` directory contains the main application layout; components and types are organized under `src/components` and `src/types` respectively.
